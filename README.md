# Console Manager â€“ Football Club Management System

A C# console application designed to manage different aspects of a football club, including coaches, employees, clubs, and financial operations.  
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and class relationships, all implemented in a menu-driven console interface.
